<li>Cleaning: Regularly clean your bike to prevent dirt buildup that can cause wear and tear. Focus on the frame, chain, gears, and brakes.

<li>Lubrication:  Lubricate the chain, derailleurs, and brake levers to ensure smooth operation and prevent rust. Use a suitable lubricant and avoid over-lubricating.

<li>Tire Care: Check tire pressure regularly and inflate to the recommended PSI. Inspect tires for wear and tear, and replace them when necessary.

<li>Brake Inspection: Ensure brakes are functioning correctly by checking pad wear, cable tension, and lever response. Adjust or replace components as needed.

<li>Gear Adjustment: Keep gears shifting smoothly by cleaning and lubricating the derailleurs and adjusting cable tension.

<li>Bolt Checks: Regularly check bolts on the handlebars, stem, seat post, and wheels to ensure they are tight and secure.

<li>Wheel Maintenance: Inspect wheels for trueness and spoke tension. If needed, true the wheels or replace damaged spokes.

<li>Periodic Overhauls: Consider a professional tune-up annually or more frequently depending on usage to address wear and tear on components like bearings and cables.
